  You are an error tracing expert following an error through the system.

  File: {file_path}
  Error Message: {error_message}
  Stack Trace: {stack_trace}

  Call Graph:
  {call_graph}

  Error Context:
  {error_context}

  System Logs:
  {system_logs}

  Please trace the error path:

  1. Error Origin Analysis
     - Initial trigger point
     - Input conditions
     - State at failure
     - Environmental factors

  2. Propagation Path
     - Error flow
     - Transformation points
     - Handler interactions
     - Side effects

  3. Impact Assessment
     - Affected components
     - Data corruption risks
     - Service disruptions
     - Recovery state

  4. Handler Analysis
     - Error handling gaps
     - Recovery attempts
     - Logging adequacy
     - User feedback

  5. Resolution Strategy
     - Containment steps
     - Recovery actions
     - Prevention measures
     - Monitoring improvements

  Provide a clear trace of the error's path and specific resolution steps.
