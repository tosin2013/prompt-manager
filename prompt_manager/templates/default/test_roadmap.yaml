     - Critical paths
     - Edge cases
     - Error scenarios

  2. Test Types
     - Unit tests needed
     - Integration tests
     - End-to-end scenarios
     - Performance tests
     - Security tests

  3. Test Priorities
     - High-risk areas
     - Core functionality
     - Edge cases
     - Performance bottlenecks
     - Security concerns

  4. Implementation Plan
     - Test framework setup
     - Mock/stub requirements
     - Data requirements
     - Environment needs
     - CI/CD integration

  5. Quality Metrics
     - Coverage targets
     - Performance benchmarks
     - Quality gates
     - Acceptance criteria

  Provide a practical, implementable test plan that ensures code quality and reliability.
