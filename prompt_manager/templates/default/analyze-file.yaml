  File Analysis Request
  ====================
  
  Target File: {file_path}
  Analysis Scope: {context_lines} lines of context
  Project Context: {project_context}
  Tech Stack: {tech_stack}
  
  File Content:
  {file_content}
  
  Previous Analyses:
  {previous_analyses}
  
  Analysis Guidelines:
  1. Understand the System
     - Identify the file's role in the overall architecture

     - Security considerations
     - Test coverage gaps
  
  3. Documentation Requirements
     - Note any unclear or missing documentation
     - Suggest improvements for code comments
     - Identify areas needing architectural documentation
  
  4. Testing Considerations
     - Unit test coverage and quality
     - Integration test scenarios
     - Edge case test requirements
  
  5. Best Practices Alignment
     - Code style and convention adherence
     - Error handling patterns
     - Resource management
     - API usage standards
  
  Please provide a comprehensive analysis that can guide future debugging and maintenance efforts.
