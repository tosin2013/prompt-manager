# Expanding Prompt Manager for AI-Assisted Development Tools

## Overview

The concepts behind Prompt Manager and its Memory Bank integration can be extended to other AI-assisted development tools such as **Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and JetBrains AI**. This guide outlines how the Prompt Manager framework can be adapted for these tools, providing persistent memory, structured documentation, and AI-driven workflow enhancements.

## 1. Core Principles of AI-Assisted Development

### **1.1 Persistent Context Tracking**

Many AI-assisted development tools lack **persistent context** across sessions. Prompt Manager’s **Memory Bank** can be adapted to:

- Store long-term project-specific details
- Track prior AI-generated code suggestions
- Maintain debugging history and architectural insights

### **1.2 Dynamic Command Execution and Enhancement**

AI-driven development benefits from:

- **Generating and refining commands dynamically** based on development needs
- **Improving code quality** by iterating on past AI-generated outputs
- **Enhancing prompt engineering** through self-improving AI workflows

## 2. Adapting Prompt Manager to Other AI Development Tools

### **2.1 Windsurf (AI Code Completion and Documentation)**

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Persistent Memory Integration:**
   - Store past suggestions, command history, and improvements in `memory/`.
   - Use structured context files like `repoAnalysis.md`, `systemCard.md`, and `progress.md`.
2. **Enable Prompt Visibility:**
   - Implement `prompt-manager llm analyze-impact --show-prompt` to **allow developers to review AI-generated code prompts**.
3. **Self-Improvement Mechanism:**
   - Track Windsurf's outputs and refine suggestions using Prompt Manager.

**Example:**

```bash
prompt-manager llm analyze-impact ./src --show-prompt
```

### **2.2 GitHub Copilot (AI Pair Programming Assistant)**

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Memory Bank Integration:**
   - Enable Copilot to **store AI-generated solutions and their effectiveness** in `memory/`.
   - Maintain `taskContext.md` to track ongoing development focus.
2. **Expose Prompt Analysis:**
   - Implement `prompt-manager llm suggest-improvements --show-prompt` to allow users to **review Copilot’s logic**.
3. **AI-Led Code Optimization:**
   - Utilize Prompt Manager’s LLM to evaluate Copilot’s output and propose refinements.

**Example:**

```bash
prompt-manager llm suggest-improvements ./module.js --show-prompt
```

---

### **2.3 JetBrains AI Assistant**

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Memory Persistence for IDE AI Tools:**
   - Store past Copilot/Windsurf suggestions in `memory/` for **context-aware AI development**.
2. **Debugging Transparency:**
   - Enable `prompt-manager debug analyze-file --show-prompt` for reviewing AI-assisted debugging insights.
3. **Adaptive AI Code Suggestions:**
   - Utilize Prompt Manager to **assess, refine, and validate JetBrains AI suggestions.**

**Example:**

```bash
prompt-manager debug analyze-file ./project --show-prompt
```

---

## 3. Universal AI Memory Bank for Prompt Manager

### **3.1 Centralized Context Storage**

For better integration across AI tools, Prompt Manager should standardize:

- `repoAnalysis.md` → AI-generated repository insights
- `systemCard.md` → System architecture & design patterns
- `taskContext.md` → Active development progress
- `debugHistory.md` → AI-assisted debugging records

### **3.2 Standardized Prompt Visibility**

All tools should implement the `--show-prompt` flag for debugging and transparency.

### **3.3 Self-Improving AI Development**

- AI-driven tools should analyze past interactions, track improvement areas, and refine their prompt engineering automatically.

---

## 4. Conclusion

By extending Prompt Manager’s capabilities to tools like **Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and JetBrains AI**, we enable:

- **Persistent memory** for AI-assisted development workflows
- **Enhanced AI transparency** through `--show-prompt`
- **AI-driven self-improvement** for code optimization and documentation

This evolution makes Prompt Manager not just a **task tracker**, but a **universal AI assistant** for software development.
